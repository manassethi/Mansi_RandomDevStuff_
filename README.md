Welcome to my collection of web projects showcasing the creativity and versatility of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository houses three distinct projects: a dynamic clock, an engaging Lamborghini animation, and a classic Tic Tac Toe game. Each project demonstrates different aspects of web development, from interactive animations to game mechanics.
